<h2> Completed steps <h2>
<p>The current state of the project consists on having 2 individual players join and change lobbies as well as being able to move the pieces and fire arrows. The game is able to detect valid moves consisting of areas where arrows are fired at, positions utilized by other queens and invalid movements from each queen. Furthermore, we have implemented the timer specified that notifies the player they are out of time on their turn.
